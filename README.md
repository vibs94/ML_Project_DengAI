# ML_Project_DengAI

Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus. Dengue spread fast
on high populated areas. Since the population density of San Juan is high compared to Iquitos,
transmission of dengue becomes easier in San Juan. The relationship and interaction between
diseases and climatic changes are very complicated. So, modeling of such relationships and
interactions has been identified as a difficult problem in many research studies. However, more
researches show that depending on the weather conditions and climate changes, dengue
transmission patterns varied between years. So, the number of dengue cases become high after
higher rainfall in warmer years. After studying the factors for more than 15 years, researches came
up with many models for predictions. Considering the above, the focus of this research study was
to explore the different climatic variables and recognize short and long-term predictors and build
a model for prediction by ensembling the results from regression methods.
